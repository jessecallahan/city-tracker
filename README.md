## Description
This project allows the user to type in a city and information is giving to them via API responses. Check 'Specs' for specifics on API calls. 

## Setup/Installation Requirements
1. Click the [link] (https://jessecallahan.github.io/city-tracker/) 
2. Enjoy

## Specs

Four different API calls:

1) Zomato - one call to the db to get 'city_entity' value for better search results, call two searching restaurant recommendations with that value.

2) Openweather API - one call using city name, returns humidity, Fahreinheit values

3) Wikipedia Api - makes general search query (q) though Wikipedia's API, returns description, name, picture

4) Google Maps - front end google maps system. Still learning about Google's JSON atmosphere.

## Bugs

1) Both the Wikipedia API and Zomato take inputs and return any value even if they are not cities.

## Technologies Used
* Npm, webpacks, js.node, API, JSON, JS ES6 ...
